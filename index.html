        <li class="Instruction">The player will input a maximum number, which sets the range of numbers from 1 to the chosen maximum (minimum: 25, maximum: 75).</li>
        <li class="Instruction">The computer will generate a random number within the range of 1 to the player’s chosen maximum number.</li>
        <li class="Instruction">The player will have up to 5 attempts to guess the random number generated by the computer.</li>
        <li class="Instruction">After each guess, the computer will indicate whether the guessed number is greater or lessen than the random number.</li>
        <li class="Instruction">If the player guesses the number correctly, they earn 1 point.</li>
        <li class="Instruction">If the player fails to guess the number within 5 attempts, the computer earns 1 point.</li>
